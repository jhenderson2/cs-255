Review
**1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design**
The DriverPass project was to build a system design for an online driver education service. The client was the DriverPass company. 
**2. What did you do particularly well?**
I was able to create the various diagrams for DriverPass well. I was concise with building the diagrams from use case diagrams to flow diagrams.
**3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would revise the Business Requiremnts document. I would improve upon what the requirements are and be more clear on functional and non-functional requirements.
**4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I interperted the user's needs with diffrent requirements; functional, non-functional requirements, etc. It is important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones paying you, and if you dont consider them they won't pay you.
**5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I approach designing software from an analytical standpoint. I would use the startagy of gathering the diffrent requirements to analyze and design the system.
